Code I extracted from the "JavaScript Web Applications" book by Alex MacCaw.

Note: This at least by now node.js dependent.

Please use node.js for running the pure JavaScript code files, for some of them you will need the 'jquery' node package. You can install it using 'npm'.

'npm' is the node.js package manager visit http://npmjs.org/ for installation instructions.

After installed npm you can easily run:

$ npm install jquery
